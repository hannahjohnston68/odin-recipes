    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Gumbo is one of the most famous dishes to result from Louisiana's shared Creole-Cajun heritage. Gumbo falls somewhere between a thick stew and a hearty soup and can contain ingredients such as chicken, sausage, ham, seafood, okra, tomatoes, and greens.
    </p>

        <li>3 quarts water</li>
        <li>6 cubes beef bouillon</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons hot pepper sauce or to taste</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon Cajun seasoning blend or to taste</li>
        <li>4 bay leaves</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon dried thyme leaves</li>
        <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can stewed tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 (6 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons file powder, divided</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons bacon drippings</li>
        <li>2 (10 ounce) packages frozen cut okra, thawed</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons distilled white vinegar</li>
        <li>1 pound lump crabmeat</li>
        <li>3 pounds uncooked medium shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the roux: Whisk together flour and 3/4 cup bacon drippings in a large, heavy saucepan over medium-low heat until smooth. Cook roux, whisking constantly, until it turns a rich mahogany brown color. This can take 20 to 30 minutes; watch heat carefully and whisk constantly or roux will burn. Remove from heat; continue whisking until mixture stops cooking.</li>
        <li>Make the gumbo: Place celery, onion, green bell pepper, and garlic into the work bowl of a food processor, and pulse until all vegetables are very finely chopped.
        </li>
        <li> Stir vegetables into the roux, and mix in sausage. Bring mixture to a simmer over medium-low heat, and cook until vegetables are tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>Combine water and beef bouillon cubes in a large Dutch oven or soup pot and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Stir until bouillon cubes dissolve, then whisk roux mixture into the boiling water.

        <li>Meanwhile, melt 2 tablespoons bacon drippings in a skillet over medium heat. Add okra and vinegar and cook for 15 minutes; remove okra with a slotted spoon, and stir into the simmering gumbo.
        </li>
        <li>Mix in crabmeat, shrimp, and Worcestershire sauce, and simmer until flavors have blended, 45 more minutes. Stir in 2 more teaspoons of file gumbo powder just before serving.
